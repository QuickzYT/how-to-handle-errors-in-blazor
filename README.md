# How to handle errors in Blazor

A simple example that showcases how to handle exceptions in Blazor by utilizing a custom error boundary. The project contains a simple counter which will throw an exception upon reaching a value of 5. Once an exception is thrown, the error boundary will handle it and render a Bootstrap alert stating the problem. Once you close it, the page will revert to it's original state.
